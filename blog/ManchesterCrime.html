                Research and various visualisations about crime in Manchester city centre area during 11.2018-06.2019<br>
            </h2>

        <h3 class="BlogText">
            <b>Introduction</b><br> 
            <br>
            The analysis aimed to explore the crime hotspots in the Manchester city centre area and to create visualisations 
            that illustrate the findings. People care if their home city is safe, and if not, where are the most dangerous 
            places to avoid. It would be good to know if any specific phenomenon needs attention.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Methodology</b><br>
            <br>
            The data was gathered from the UK Police website (Data downloads, 2019). Only the Greater Manchester Police street 
            crime data was downloaded and processed. The available months were November 2018 to Jun 2019. Police have recorded 
            the reports for crime tracking and made the data publicly available. The locations have been anonymised by grouping 
            them near addresses which have many postal addresses or are above a commercial premise like a Shopping Centre or 
            Nightclub. <br> <br>
            For the first visualisation, Google Sheets was used for creating an initial bar chart. It was exported to photoshop 
            and transformed into a more engaging graphic with a glorious hand picture from Jeff Hardi (Hardi, 2019). <br> <br>
            Maps were made with ArcGIS Online mapping tool and later framed and finalised in Photoshop. The area mapped and 
            analysed is a hand-picked view between coordinates (53.4604, -2.2884) to (53.4975, -2.1821) latitude and longitude 
            accordingly. It consisted of 33 288 crimes out of 256 313 Greater Manchester area crimes. <br> <br>
            Density analysis was used to map the crime hotspots. More specifically, it's using the algorithm from the Kernel 
            Density tool in ArcGIS Pro under the hood (Calculate Density, 2022). The Calculate Density tool calculated an 
            appropriate search distance for determining neighbourhood size, did not clip the output, classified the output as 
            an equal interval with 10 classes, and provided the output densities per square kilometres that were converted to 
            per 100 square meters for a more relatable legend, since kilometers are too lengthy in the sense of a city area. 
            (Calculate Density, 2022). The analysis ran five times. Violence and sexual offences, vehicle crime, anti-social 
            behaviour, public order and theft from the person were all analysed. Yet, only the first two, the most distinctive, 
            were chosen. <br> <br>
            The pictures on the right-hand side are from Google Street View (Google Inc, 2020, 2021). However, the Piccadilly 
            Gardens photo is by Shishir Pandey (Pandey, 2020) and Gay Village photo by Lisanna Põlluaas (Põlluaas, 2021).<br>

            <br>
            <b>Visual choices</b><br>
            <br>
            The first visualisation (Figure 1) is a general bar chart that describes all the crime types 
            and their counts. Its dark theme and blood shaded bars with the hand photograph represent 
            crime as a horrible experience. The category labels were not that long to use horizontal bars 
            so they are diagonal, which feels balanced. For the ease of quick look, the bars were sorted 
            (Module 03: Thinking with Charts, 2021). <br>
            <br>
            <b>Overview</b><br>
            <br>
            There were 33 288 crimes from which Violence and sexual offences, reported 7 070 times, occur the most in the 
            Manchester city area. The second most reported crime type is anti-social behaviour, recorded 5 264 times. 
            UKCrimeStats (Greater Manchester Police, 2019) shows information about the Greater Manchester area for the same 
            period and has a similar ranking, namely violence in the lead. An older Verisure (Manchester Crime Statistics, 2016) 
            research for 2015-2016 shows that anti-social behaviour was the most problematic in Manchester. Hence violence, 
            sex offences and anti-social behaviour have been the biggest concerns of the Manchester city area during previous 
            years. <br>
            <br>

            <b>Heat map of all crimes</b><br>
            <div class="VIZ"><img  src="../Static/HeatMap.png" alt="Bar Chart" style="width: 100%; transform: scale(1.05);"></div>

            <br>
            The heat map (Figure 2) shows the distribution of all the crimes reported in Manchester. It gives a realistic 
            overview of the situation before moving on with the more specific density analysis maps. Crime usually happens 
            more at night, so the map is designed dark. The heat map colours represent fire. Colder represents a lower crime 
            count (lower than 5 crimes), and the brightest parts illustrate the places with the highest crime activity 
            (higher than 500 crimes). <br>
            <br>
            <b>Findings</b><br>
            <br>
            The brightest spots are around Picadilly Gardens and Market street. The hot point at the top is HM Prison Manchester. 
            Marron Place, Bootle Street (under Manchester label) and Gay Village (long heat line on the right of the city centre) 
            also have high <br> <br>
            crime activity in the city area. Finally, the Metrolink Deansgate Castlefield tram stop area seems to have a high crime rate. 
            Manchester EveningNews (Robson, 2019) mentioned all of these places as the worst crime places except for Marron Place and 
            Bootle Street. However, they have written about Bootle Street in another article (Cachia and Osuh, 2019) related to unsafe 
            clubbing. All three, Deansgate, Marron Place and Bootle Street, are probably closely connected by the location. In conclusion, 
            the biggest crime hotspots tend to be publicly popular places, for example, festival sites or shopping and clubbing areas. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Violence and sexual offences</b><br>
            <div class="VIZ"><img  src="../Static/ViolenceMap.png" alt="Bar Chart" style="width: 100%;"></div><br>
            Figure 3: Violence and sexual offences density distribution in Manchester city area (Data downloads, 2019)<br>

            <b>Visual choices</b><br>
            <br>
            The first density analysis map is about violence and sexual offences (Figure 3). Black, often related to death, 
            represents the densest area for criminal activity. The lighter the red colour, the less crime area has. 
            The light gray map provides a comfortable and dull background for the bright red colors to follow the first rule of 
            Eduard Imhof’s colour use (Imhof, 2007). There is a legend box on the left top corner for more specific colour codes 
            and the data source. The map also includes pictures of the top 3 places to help people recall these locations better.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Findings</b><br>
            <br>
            The most high-risk areas regarding violence and sex offences are already known places. Picadilly Gardens, Gay Village 
            and Bootle Street were the hottest spots on the previous heat map, and it is the same case here. The more intriguing 
            part is that there's one light spot in the city centre, between Manchester Central Convention Complex, Midland Hotel 
            and Bridgewater Hall. It might be the case that violent gangs do not prefer to hang out in front of convention centres 
            or concert venues. There is a hotspot with a maximum density of 0.1731 crimes per 100 m2 at the bottom of the map. It 
            is the location of the Manchester Royal Infirmary. One of the worst crimes that recently had taken place was a robbery 
            from a double amputee after he had just woken up from a six-week coma (Whitbread, 2021). Even the place where people 
            get help and treatment includes criminal activity.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Vehicle crime</b><br>
            <div class="VIZ"><img  src="../Static/VehicleMap.png" alt="Bar Chart" style="width: 100%;"></div><br>
            Figure 4: Vehicle crime density distribution in Manchester city area (Data downloads, 2019)<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Visual choices</b><br>
            <br>
            The second density analysis map is about vehicle crime (Figure 4). Blue hue should be one of the least frequently 
            occurring colours in humans. Hence it was chosen to represent cars and other vehicles. Dark blue colour value means 
            densest, and lighter blues mean less density in those areas. Again there is a legend box on the left top corner with 
            extra information and pictures of the top 3 places. Note that all the previous density and heat map areas with smooth 
            edges are algorithmic estimations that do not depict the actual crime borders. This was criticized by William Rankin 
            that by using these methods, maps become ubiquitous (Rankin, 2020). However, if this information is acquired wisely, 
            then these maps illustrate the most critical points well.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Findings</b><br>
            <br>
            Surprisingly all the top 3 hotspots are near railway stations. More specifically, the parking lots around the stations 
            show a high density of vehicle crimes. Probably it's because of a large number of people, wanting to travel by train or 
            need to park before walking to the city centre, often leaving their car there. Therefore the nearest parking spaces 
            have many opportunities for thieves and rebels. Railway stations can be great at spreading crime. In a study about the 
            effect of public transit on crime conducted by David C. Phillips and Danielle Sandler, it was found that shutting down 
            stations will reduce crime by 5% at other connected stations (Phillips and Sandler, 2014). It may make sense that 
            thieves and hooligans use more public than private transport and would want to get their hands on something right away 
            when they have arrived. Since there are rows of cars under poor supervision then this translates to crime dense areas 
            around railway stations. <br>
            <br>
            The highest vehicle crime density per 100 m2 is at the Manchester Piccadilly station parking area. Manchester 
            EveningNews wrote an entire article about Store Street Car Park, which is next to it, how there are even police warning 
            signs that there are thieves around (Gregson, 2021). The second place is Manchester Oxford Road and the third Manchester 
            Victoria railway station area. <br>
            <br>
            There is another darker blue spot around the Skyline Central complex. This study does not have an answer as to why this 
            is the case. Moreover, there is a similar unknown situation with Deansgate, which doesn’t have that many vehicle crimes 
            compared to other stations but is part of the four main Manchester railway stations.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Conclusion</b><br>
            <br>
            This analysis focused on Manchester city centre rather than the whole Greater Manchester area. The findings and 
            visualisations give a new picture of the situation during the eight months November 2018 to June 2019. The crime rate 
            was high during that period, and it was valuable to examine. <br>
            <br>
            Violence and sexual offences were demonstrated to be the case in well-known areas and clubs. Unfortunately, even near 
            hospitals, there might be a high probability of being exposed to criminal activity. Railway stations’ parking spaces 
            came to be hotspots for vehicle crime and should be avoided until the security measures are increased. <br>
            <br>
            This research has been done with data from almost three years ago. Hence it may not depict the actual situation anymore. 
            The data used is less than a year, and months like July, August, September and October were left out though these could 
            play a considerable role in the final results. <br>
            <br>
            Hopefully, this paper can be helpful to understand the crime situation in Manchester city centre and provide insight 
            for authorities or be a starting point for further investigation. For example, why does the Skyline Central area have 
            a high vehicle crime density or is Bridgewater Hall's front side a safe zone? Altogether, big thanks to everyone who 
            gathered the data, took photos of these places and wrote interesting articles about this topic. <br>
